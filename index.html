      Hi there! I'm Felix. 
    </h1>
    <div class = "info">
      <p>A researcher and R enthusiast based in San Diego, I 
    presently work at UCSD's AntiViral Research Center.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class = "info">
        At the
        <a href="http://avrc.ucsd.edu">AVRC</a>
        I work on the statistics team
        where I build tools for principal researchers to make their jobs easier.
        Currently I'm developing a report automation application using 
        <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com" >Shiny</a>
        <a href="https://plot.ly/r/" >Plotly</a>
        and their 
        <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions" >many extensions.</a>
      </li>
      <li class = "info">
        I also love building things with tools other than code: I'm cooking my way through the 
        <a href="https://moosewoodcooks.com/products-page/cookbooks/sundays-at-moosewood-restaurant/" >Moosewood Collective's iconic cookbook</a>
        , and I'm learning how to develop film.
      </li>
      <li class = "info">
        I'm passionate about education and access. At the University of Vermont, I helped coordinate action efforts to implement
        <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/gender-inclusive-restrooms" >all-gender restrooms</a>
        and other gender-inclusive resources across campus.

        I spent the past summer volunteering on a number of farms in Germany, including 
        <a href="https://www.honigmanufaktureggers.de/" >a honey farm</a>
        , 
        <a href="https://mapcarta.com/ChIJnW4IOixiukcRuv1hbil4qTk" >a bed and breakfast</a>
        , and 
        <a href="http://coconat-space.com/" >a coworking space</a>
        . I plan on doing it again soon.

      <li class = "info">
        In my free time, I maintain this page and 
        <a href="https://www.github.com/felixetorres" >other cool things.</a>
